This repo generates Palumbo et al. (in prep.) using the [showyourwork](https://github.com/showyourwork/showyourwork) workflow. This paper was written with and presents version 2.0.x of [GRASS](https://github.com/palumbom/GRASS). All other package dependencies are documented in the Project.toml, which showyourwork will use to instantiate required environment.
